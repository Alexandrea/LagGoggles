**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior

**If you are using SpongeForge, which version are you using?**

**Please provide the early startup messages starting with _[LagGoggles-Boot]_**
<!-- This is needed to ensure that you read my the messages and are not putting out a report when it clearly states that the SpongeForge versions do not match -->
Example:
```
Replace me!
[00:00:00] [main/INFO] [LagGoggles-Boot]: I am located here: blablabla/bla/blaa/blala/LagGoggles-FAT-1.12.2-4.4.jar!\cf\terminator\laggoggles\Main.class
[00:00:00] [main/INFO] [LagGoggles-Boot]: I am designed for Forge version: 14.23.5.2838
[00:00:00] [main/INFO] [LagGoggles-Boot]: Loading client classes
[00:00:00] [main/INFO] [LagGoggles-Boot]: SpongeForge is present!
[00:00:00] [main/INFO] [LagGoggles-Boot]: I am designed for SpongeForge version: 1.12.2-2838-7.1.7-RC3812
[00:00:00] [main/WARN] [LagGoggles-Boot]: SpongeForge version is different than expected!
[00:00:00] [main/WARN] [LagGoggles-Boot]: This could result in undefined behavior.
[00:00:00] [main/WARN] [LagGoggles-Boot]: 
[00:00:00] [main/WARN] [LagGoggles-Boot]: Expected: '1.12.2-2838-7.1.7-RC3812', but you have: '1.12.2-2838-7.1.7-RC3785' installed.
[00:00:00] [main/INFO] [LagGoggles-Boot]: We're running in a production environment.
```

**If you used the word 'error' somewhere, always provide the stack trace along with both _debug.log_ and _latest.log_**
